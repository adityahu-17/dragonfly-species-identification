"I was out with my camera, photographing a pair of Golden Dartlet damselflies(Ischnura rubilio), one of the prettiest damselflies of our region. They were ready to mate and he was holding the female. The males uses his anal-appendages to clasp the female by the neck . Once the male tightens his grip its difficult for a female to escape .\n\nWhile I was busy clicking few images, suddently a female Ground skimmer(Diplacodes trivialis ) came and caught the mating pair and started feeding on the male Golden Dartlet while the female damselfly was still hanging on to the male. I could see the tiny female damselfly was frantically flapping her wings and shaking her body to get away from her mate . In a few minutes it was over. The Ground skimmer finished her meal of that golden Dartlet male, along with the helpless female.

"So we asked why damselflies have these beautiful blue bands on their abdomen. We tested if females like these blue bands but found that female did not choose their mate based on male colour (why will you? colour changes! and not always tells how good the males are). We, however, found that males blue bands tell other males not to mate with them (aka, I am not the date you are looking mate; please don't waste your and my time please). \n\nMoral: When life is short, competition for mating is very high, and everyone around you is crazy for coupling, it is vital to express your sexual preference, nicely but boldly.\n\nNow if you are a science nerd:\n\n","2019-09-06T20:28:45+0000","216593478390203_2427920413924154","","",""
